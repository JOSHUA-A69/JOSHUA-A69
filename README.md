### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Joshua Russel Uy, hailing from the picturesque province of Bohol, Philippines. I take pride in my cooperative spirit, resilience, and unwavering determination. I am adept at adapting to diverse situations and maintaining composure under pressure. My approach to challenges involves innovative problem-solving and continuous self-improvement. I am committed to cultivating meaningful relationships, demonstrating empathy, and embracing a calm and thoughtful demeanor. I set daily goals and value authenticity and genuineness in all interactions.

I want to work in IT, and I'm considering becoming a software engineer, a web developer who focuses on the front-end, or someone who uses a certain set of tools and languages.
